This is a system configure file, containing body and joint information.
The body itself is a 2d circle, and moves in 2d space. This subroutine is passed
into Dyn3dRun.ipynb to set up a specific system of rigid bodies. The circle
is freely falling, with the joint un-mounted from inertial space by a planar joint

This circle is in x-z plane and falls in z direction.
